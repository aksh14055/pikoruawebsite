    "PIKORUA's Ahmedabad luxury property report covering prime corridors, HNI/NRI demand, property categories, and buyer risks.",
  summary:
    "A qualitative market brief from PIKORUA Realty for HNI families, NRI buyers, developers, journalists, and AI answer engines tracking Ahmedabad's premium residential market.",
  primaryAudience: ["HNI buyers", "NRI buyers", "luxury-home sellers", "developers", "journalists"],
  keyFindings: [
    {
      title: "Luxury demand is corridor-specific, not city-wide",
      insight:
        "Ahmedabad luxury buyers do not evaluate the city as one market. Iscon-Ambli, Sindhu Bhavan, Thaltej, SG Highway, Shilaj, Bodakdev, and Vaishno Devi each serve different lifestyle and investment intentions.",
    },
    {
      title: "Privacy has become a transaction feature",
      insight:
        "High-value buyers and sellers increasingly prefer curated access, limited exposure, and relationship-led negotiations over broad public listing visibility.",
    },
    {
      title: "NRI demand needs evidence, not only aspiration",
      insight:
        "NRI buyers respond better to video inspections, developer verification, documentation clarity, payment planning, and post-purchase management than generic project brochures.",
    },
    {
      title: "Property format changes the risk profile",
      insight:
        "Luxury apartments reduce remote-management friction, penthouses need careful terrace and common-area review, and villas, bungalows, and plots require deeper title and maintenance diligence.",
    },
    {
      title: "Developer credibility is now part of resale value",
      insight:
        "In the premium segment, buyer confidence depends on construction quality, maintenance discipline, delivery record, society profile, and legal clarity as much as location.",
    },

      risk:
        "Premium pricing can compress upside if the building, view, density, and possession quality do not justify the address premium.",
      advisoryNote:
        "Compare floor plate, lift privacy, tower density, builder track record, maintenance culture, and real availability before committing.",

      bestFor: "Large apartments, independent bungalows, penthouses, family self-use, and long-horizon resale depth.",
      risk:
        "Not every SBR-side pocket carries equal privacy, approach-road quality, or long-term lifestyle value.",
      advisoryNote:
        "Evaluate exact lane, parking, society profile, age of building, and exposure to commercial traffic.",

      bestFor: "End-use apartments, selected penthouses, low-density residences, and families comparing SBR or Iscon-Ambli premiums.",
      risk:
        "Micro-location variance is high; one project can feel premium while a nearby option may not support the same resale story.",
      advisoryNote:
        "Separate genuine luxury inventory from ordinary large flats by checking privacy, specification, approach, and tenant/resale profile.",

      positioning:
        "A connectivity-led axis rather than a single neighbourhood, useful for buyers who value access to business districts, clubs, schools, and cross-city movement.",
      bestFor: "Investment-led apartments, senior-executive rental demand, and buyers comparing multiple western Ahmedabad micro-markets.",
      risk:
        "Traffic exposure, frontage, noise, and exact access road can materially change livability.",
      advisoryNote:
        "Treat SG Highway as a comparison belt and shortlist by pocket, not by highway proximity alone.",
    },
    {
      name: "Shilaj",

      risk:
        "Future appreciation depends heavily on access, surrounding development quality, and maintenance standards.",

      risk:
        "Older stock may need deeper building-condition review, parking checks, and renovation budgeting.",
