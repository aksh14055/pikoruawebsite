    ],
    bodyContent: [
      "### The USA NRI Buying Journey",
      "Buying a luxury flat in Ahmedabad from the USA is a fully manageable remote process with the right advisory support. The typical journey has six stages: (1) shortlisting via virtual tour and corridor analysis; (2) legal due diligence (title, RERA, encumbrance); (3) POA drafting and apostille in the US; (4) NRE account inward remittance confirmation with your US and Indian banks; (5) sale agreement review by an Indian property lawyer; and (6) registration (handled by POA holder) and possession.",
      "### Currency Conversion Context",
      "The USD/INR exchange rate creates a dynamic opportunity window for US-based NRI buyers. When the rupee weakens against the dollar, US NRIs receive more rupees per dollar — effectively reducing the dollar-denominated cost of Ahmedabad property. A ₹4 Cr luxury flat at ₹84/USD costs approximately US$476,000. A 5% rupee depreciation (to ₹88/USD) would reduce the dollar cost to approximately US$454,000 for the same property — a meaningful difference for high-value transactions.",
      "### US FBAR and FATCA Considerations",
      "US persons who own or control foreign financial accounts or foreign property above certain thresholds may have US reporting obligations. This is a complex area that requires US-qualified tax advice. PIKORUA Realty strongly recommends engaging a US CPA with India expertise before any payment commitment. We can introduce qualified CA contacts for the India tax side; US tax counsel is the buyer's responsibility.",
      "### NRI Property Management from the USA",
      "One of the most common concerns for US-based NRI buyers is how to manage an Ahmedabad property remotely. PIKORUA Realty provides referrals to qualified property management firms in Ahmedabad who handle tenant sourcing, rent collection, maintenance coordination, society dealings, and periodic inspections on behalf of overseas owners. The management fee is typically 8–10% of monthly rental income.",

      },
      {
        question: "Can USA NRIs repatriate profits from Ahmedabad property sales?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Under FEMA, NRIs can repatriate sale proceeds up to the original investment amount made through NRE/NRO accounts, subject to conditions and tax compliance. A CA and an authorised dealer bank should be involved before any repatriation. US tax on repatriated Indian property gains must also be confirmed with a US-qualified tax advisor.",

    bodyContent: [
      "### Ahmedabad vs US Real Estate: An NRI Comparison",
      "US NRI investors face a genuine choice between Indian and US real estate. US real estate offers dollar exposure, mature market data, and established legal frameworks — but also high entry prices (especially in coastal cities), property taxes, vacancy risk, and management challenges. Ahmedabad offers India growth-market exposure, family utility, potential currency appreciation, and a growing institutional rental market — but also FEMA compliance complexity, remote management requirements, and builder risk.",
      "### The USD/INR Investment Angle",
      "For US NRIs, the rupee exchange rate is not just a currency conversion — it is a potential return amplifier. If an NRI buys a ₹4 Cr Ahmedabad flat when the rate is ₹84/USD (costing US$476,000), and the flat appreciates to ₹5 Cr when the rate has returned to ₹80/USD, the US dollar value of the property is US$625,000 — a 31% dollar return on a 25% rupee appreciation. Currency can work significantly in the buyer's favour over 5–7 year horizons.",
      "### Rental Income from the USA",
      "PIKORUA Realty's network of Ahmedabad property managers enables US NRI investors to receive rental income into their NRO account without requiring a single India visit. Monthly rental income is transferred to the NRO account and can be repatriated to the US within FEMA limits after applicable Indian tax deduction (TDS). The net rental yield after management fees and TDS is typically 1.5–3.5% for prime western Ahmedabad luxury apartments.",
