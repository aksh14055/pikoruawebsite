      { question: "Is commercial real estate safer than FD in India?", answer: "FDs are insured (DICGC up to ₹5L per bank) and highly liquid — making them structurally safer in a financial-risk sense. Commercial property has no insurance, has tenant/vacancy risk, and requires 60–180 days to exit. However, commercial property's total returns (12–18% p.a.) dwarf FD returns (6.5–7%) over 5–10 year horizons." },

      { question: "How are FD interest and commercial property rent taxed differently?", answer: "FD interest is taxed at slab rate (up to 30% for HNIs) with TDS at 10%. Commercial property rental income is taxed as income from house property with a 30% standard deduction — effective tax is lower. Additionally, commercial property gains after 24 months attract 20% LTCG with indexation — far more tax-efficient than FD interest for HNIs." },

PIKORUA restricts its new launch advisory to projects from developers who have delivered at least two comparable projects on schedule.",
          "The pricing discount on new launches is real — but so is the time value cost. ₹3 Cr locked in a 36-month under-construction project has an opportunity cost of ₹60–90L in foregone FD interest or alternative deployment.

PIKORUA's advisory covers builder due diligence to mitigate these." },

This multi-directional connectivity means tenant demand is not dependent on a single employment zone — reducing vacancy risk materially.",

India's generic pharma industry, centred in Ahmedabad with Sun Pharma, Torrent, Cadila, and Zydus anchoring a broader ecosystem, employs 30,000+ professionals in science city and adjacent areas.

GIFT City's employment base is scaling rapidly. And Ahmedabad's price-per-sq.ft. still sits 40–60% below equivalent Mumbai addresses — suggesting the rerating cycle is still in its early phase. Here is PIKORUA's annual market assessment for serious investors.",

Total deliverable units in this corridor over the next 36 months: approximately 350–400 units. Against an annual absorption of 180–220 units, the supply pipeline will not significantly relieve price pressure.",

RERA registrations for luxury projects (₹2 Cr+ ticket size) in Ahmedabad totalled 1,240 units in FY2025-26, up from 890 units in FY2024-25. Absorption rate: approximately 1,100 units.

          "None of these demand drivers appear reversible in the near term. Even in a GDP growth slowdown scenario, NRI demand and HNI aspirational buying in Ahmedabad's luxury segment has demonstrated resilience — as evidenced by 2020–2022's COVID-period appreciation.",

    faqs: [
      { question: "Will Ahmedabad property prices increase in 2026?", answer: "PIKORUA's base case projects 12–18% appreciation in prime luxury corridors in 2026, supported by constrained supply, rising NRI demand, GIFT City employment expansion, and Ahmedabad's continued undervaluation relative to Mumbai on a per-sq.ft. basis. A broader economic slowdown would moderate but not reverse this trend." },
      { question: "Is 2026 a good time to buy luxury property in Ahmedabad?", answer: "Yes, for investors with a 5+ year horizon. Prices are still 40–60% below Mumbai equivalents, prime supply is genuinely constrained, and the GIFT City employment catalyst is in early innings. The risk is overpaying in corridors that have already delivered 85%+ appreciation — PIKORUA's advisory identifies value within corridors, not just corridors." },

The buyer reviews this lease before purchase — and the quality of the lease terms is often more important than the property location.",

Professionally, the IFSC framework allows NRI-owned entities to operate from India's only international financial jurisdiction. As real estate investors, NRIs can access GIFT City's commercial yield through direct property purchase or benefit from the residential spillover demand on SG Highway.
