 * 10x Programmatic SEO — Layer 5: Micro-Location Pages
 *
 * URL pattern:  /ahmedabad/[location]/[type]
 * Examples:     /ahmedabad/thaltej/luxury-flats
 *               /ahmedabad/bodakdev/penthouses
 *               /ahmedabad/sg-highway/investment-properties
 *
 * These pages sit at the intersection of a named micro-location (neighbourhood)
 * and a property type — capturing hyper-local SEO queries like
 * "luxury flats in Thaltej Ahmedabad" that existing pages do not cover.
 *
 * Route structure uses two separate dynamic segments:
 *   /ahmedabad/[location]/[type]
 *
 * Since `dynamicParams = false` is set on the route and all slugs are
 * enumerated via generateStaticParams(), there is no runtime conflict with
 * the /ahmedabad/[type]/[filter] route — Next.js resolves them at build time.
 *
 * The `href` field for every page here uses the pattern:
 *   /ahmedabad/locations/[location]/[type]
 *
 * This ensures no slug collision with the [type]/[filter] pages because
 * the first segment after /ahmedabad/ is "locations" (a literal string),
 * not a property-type slug like "luxury-flats".

      "Sindhubhavan Road's defining characteristic is its address recognition — not just its residential quality. For NRI buyers, HNI families, and sellers of high-value homes, SBR is the Ahmedabad address that the Gujarati diaspora recognises without explanation. This recognition premium sustains both demand and pricing during market cycles when other corridors face absorption challenges.",
      "### Premium Apartments on SBR",
      "Luxury apartments directly on Sindhubhavan Road and in its immediate inner lanes command a premium over equivalent units in adjacent areas. The finest buildings offer 4–5 BHK floor plates of 3,000–6,000 sq.ft. with private lift lobbies, large sundecks, and immediate walking access to SBR's lifestyle infrastructure. Supply of genuinely premium apartments in this configuration is scarce — making private advisory access the primary way to stay informed of availability.",

      "### Ahmedabad's Rarest Asset",
      "A penthouse on Iscon Ambli Road is the rarest residential asset in Ahmedabad's market. The combination of the city's highest corridor pricing (₹11,000–₹15,000 per sq.ft. for standard floors), a penthouse premium (20–40% above standard floor), and ultra-scarcity (fewer than 5 annual transactions) creates a market where price discovery happens entirely through private advisory relationships.",
      "PIKORUA Realty's access to Iscon Ambli Road penthouse inventory is maintained through long-term relationships with building owners, developers, and the private buyer community — not through public portal aggregation. Contact us privately for a confidential shortlist.",
